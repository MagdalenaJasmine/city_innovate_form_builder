## City Innovate Form Builder 
This app was created using React and Material UI (MUI). 
What you can do: 
- login (there is no user auth for the login page for this assignment) 
- Add a form title and description 
- add questions
- edit finished questions
- change the question type. The question types are text, multiple choice, and checkbox 
- edit the question and multiple choice or checkbox options 
- remove multiple choice and checkbox options 
-delete questions 

What you can't do: 
- add different media types 
- drag and drop 

### Tradeoffs

#Bugs/Things to Fix 
- the question title and description form currently has some funky sizing on larger screens.
- when you add an option to a question it automatically generates an option name which you then need to go back and edit
